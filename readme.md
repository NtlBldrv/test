## BEWARE!

What you are about to witness is not such a good code. I've never used Laravel in my life, I can solve the test-task using 
Symfony in about 8-10 hours, using Laravel though... I tried, I read, I tried again. 
In my head I have the structure of the system (kind of OOP stuff) that would solve the test-task, 
for now I just lack the instruments to bring it to life.
But! I'm a fast learner, not like 2-days-since-I-first-met-Laravel learner, but really really fast.
So, welcome to my code, I hope it will work when you see it (probably still not working, but hope is still with me).
